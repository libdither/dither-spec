# Common Primitives for Self-Defining Structures

These primitive types are defined by the implementation of Dither. They can be identified through hashes that count up from 0.

For more detailed explanations see the [hashtypes](hashtypes.md) document

`VarUInt` - Dynamically sized unsigned integer

`Layout` - Layout for defining structures

`Unknown` - Dynamically sized unknown data (defined by wrapper types with Traits)

`Trait` - Reverse-Linked trait that defines inputs and outputs for a program implementation

`Program`
