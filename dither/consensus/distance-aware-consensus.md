# Area-Aware Consensus

Why Area-Aware? Information takes time to travel and sometimes consensus only needs to be done in a local manner. With plans for colonies on other planets within decades, consensus algorithms that are aware of the time it takes for information to travel and don't require the consensus of all the computers in the network will be invaluable.

## Tiered Consensus

Create tiered layers of consensus at different scales that cover different numbers of people, each high layer covering more people and being slower than the last.

Imagine a cryptocurrency that serves the people in City A. To make a transaction in this city, each person must have the few hundred people running consensus nodes in the city come to consensus on the order and validity of the transaction. This would be very fast because it is on a local level with only a few hundred nodes participating in the consensus protocol.

Now what if someone in City A wanted to send money to a resident of City B? Well, each city's consensus network keeps track of the total amount of money in the wallets of the city's residents. When a transaction between cities is required, the local consensus computers of the city will communicate 

What if we could create a tiered layer of consensus that takes into account how fast information travels and can account for different items of consensus being needed at different scales. For example, for a cryptocurrency each city could have its own consensus network, and only when transactions are going outside the city will the city's consensus network need to communicate and create consensus with other city's consensus networks. This tiered system could even be expanded to interplanetary transactions making it really efficient to send money to other planets, no requiring whole planets of computers to create consensus with each other, or expensive exchanges.

Consensus Networks act as peers themselves and establish 

## Per Argument Consensus

Another idea might be Argument-based consensus. This type of consensus only makes computers who are near to the named relevant parties (and areas) of the network subject to consensus. For example, if Alice wants to transact with Bob, this requires Alice's "network neighborhood" to verify that Alice has money to spend, and it requires Bob's neighborhood to take note of the new money Bob has. 

## Downsides

The main problem with Area-Aware consensus is that money is stuck in a specific area. This can be overcome by divvying up your money into wallets in different places or simply waiting for the transfer.
