# Consensus Ideas

List of various consensus algorithms' pros & cons that could be utilized by Dither for different applications

 - Proof of Work
   - Cons
     - Very inefficient & slow (transactions take multiple minutes or more to verify)
     - Uses a lot of energy
     - Causes avenue of abuse for malware crypto miners
     - Requires sufficient size of network to be trusted
     - Large storage requirements for full node
     - Miners congregate into centralized pools
     - Slowness pushes to centralization
   - Pros
     - Simple to understand, easy to implement
     - Easy
 - Proof of Stake
   - Cons
     - Only works for cryptocurrencies (need staking incentive)
     - Faster than proof of work
     - Large storage requirements for full node
   - Pros
     - Faster and more energy efficient than proof of stake
 - Stellar Consensus Protocol (Byzantine Federated Voting)
   - Cons
     - Large storage requirements for full node
     - Uncertain consensus (health of network slices can't be judged)
     - Tendency towards centralization
     - Lots of packets
   - Pros
     - ~5 seconds / transaction, extremely low transaction fees
     - Can be integrated with social media to reflect IRL social connections as quorum slices.
 - Nano Consensus Protocol
   - Cons
     - More ways to compromise network, no reward for running nodes
     - Potential DDOS vectors with transaction flooding.
   - Pros
     - Really fast (<1 second transactions if no conflict), no transaction fees.
 - IOTA Consensus Protocol
   - Cons
     - Potential attacks due to adversaries with 33% of network hashing power
     - Requires centralized coordination node until the network reaches a certain size
     - Requires periodic counting of tangle to eliminate history.
   - Pros
     - Really fast, No transaction fees
     - Very good scalability due to probabilistic consensus algorithm
 - Hedera Hashgraph
   - Cons
     - Potentially large storage requirements
     - Very centralized (nodes have to be registered with a central entity)
     - 1/3 attack
     - Consensus depends on network knowing the number of total nodes
     - Doesn't scale very well
   - Pros
     - Pretty fast (as fast as Stellar Consensus Protocol)
     - Hashgraph is interesting concept
 - [Dither Distance-Aware Consensus](distance-aware-consensus.md) (WIP)
   - Pros
     - Transaction speed is faster the closer the wallets are to each other in the network. (Sub second times for close nodes)
     - Negligent storage & computational requirements for full node
     - Localized Transactions (i.e. someone on the other side of the world doesn't have a record of your transaction).
     - Network 
   - Cons
     - Potential loss of ownership of funds if enough nodes in a certain area go down (mitigated by distributing funds or slower, backup consensus algorithm)
     - Its a work in progress.
