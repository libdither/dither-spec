# Advantages for Dither

The plan behind Dither is to create an modern internet unencumbered by any kind of central control. To accomplish this, Dither must somehow replace existing apps and services *by outcompeting them*. This is an incredibly monumental task, but here are some things that may help in Dither's favor.

 - **No Hosting Costs** — Being decentralized means the users host everything. If we can create a system to make it as painless as possible to host data and move it where you choose, no institutions that manage large numbers of computers and require large amounts of money are necessary.
 - **Flexible Applications** — If applications using Dither are fundamentally better designed than the alternative, due to them taking advantage of Dither's decentralized nature and modularity/interoperability. It will be easy to switch, and users will be more likely to use them.
 - **Standardization and Modularity** — Dither's ecosystem of APIs will all be compatible with each other, [down to UI components](../applications/d-framework/d-framework.md), which will infinitely improve the experience of the user. (Imagine being able to use a Discord-like chat room or a Reddit-like comment system underneath a YouTube video, or really any kind of system you want. It's all modular!).
 - **Self-Regulation with Social & Economic Incentives** — P2P networks are fundamentally difficult to control by the government. One benefit of this is that Dither can disregard government-mandated monopolies (i.e. Intellectual property), since not only would distribution of protected material be made impossible to stop, so would profiting off of derivative work, or other intellectual property violations. On the one hand it would allow Applications built on Dither to easily compete for users with centralized platforms. On the other hand, it would make Dither a target. To avoid this, social and economic incentives should be used to create a system for users to directly ensure the livelihoods of those who create content. (NOTE: link to relevant idea once article is finished). It may also be of benefit to allow for a blacklist system to take content off the "default" distribution of Dither software.

# Disadvantages for Dither

 - Morally objectionable material (i.e. CSAM)
   - Idea: allow computers to collectively isolate computers serving certain content from the network. (And perhaps report such computers to the authority)
     - Subject to politics, might fragment network...
 - TODO: There are lots of problems big and small that a P2P protocol & platform like Dither might run into. List them here.
