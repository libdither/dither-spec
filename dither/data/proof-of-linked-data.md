# Proof of Linked Data

The idea behind proof of linked data is that if you have the hash of a hashtype. You can prove things about that hashtype.

The behind proof of linked data is asking the question: "prove that when function x is applied to the data that generates hash y, results in z".

Potential applications of this simple concept are endless:
 - put burden of proof on the creater of the object.
 - is the linked type of type `<insert type here>`?
 - is linked hashtype [correct and valid](hashtypes/hashtypes.md)?
 - are the hashtypes linked to from linked hashtype correct & valid?
 - is the hashtype linked to signed by public key x?
 - does the linked hashtype eventually link to hash x?

Now, I'm not entirely sure if all these applications are even possible, but zero knowledge proofs should allow for some of these applications.
