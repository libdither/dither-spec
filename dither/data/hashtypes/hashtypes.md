# Hashtypes

Hash types are how Dither deals with data. 

A fundamental property of hash types are that they describe their own domain. This includes: what data types make up the domain (i.e. bytes, types, other data types) and how those datatypes may be restricted (i.e. a data type might be variable in length depending on another type like a list).

## Fundamental Types

There are a few fundamental types.

### `Multihash` type

### `Expr` type

Reflects Lambda Calculus



Expr can be interpreted as 3 things:

Bind Variant: (Varint)

Lambda Variant: (`Multihash<Expr>`, `Multihash<Expr>`)

Application Variant: 

### `Type` type

### `
