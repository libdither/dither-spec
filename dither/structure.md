# Structure

This document outlines the major structure of Dither.

## Service Manager

At the core of Dither is the service manager. This will be written in Rust and only one instance should run on any given user account.

The service manager comes in 2 parts, each with its own API.
 - The Service Manager
   - This starts and stops, manages state, connections between services, and isolates them from the rest of the system.
 - The Transport API
