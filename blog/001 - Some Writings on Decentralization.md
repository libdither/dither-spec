Hello! I’m Zyansheep, and this is a blog to put my ideas out in the world. I will primarily be talking about Dither—my project to decentralize the internet, as well as Disp, a programming language to help make that happen. My goal is to put something out once a week, whether that be talking about and refining my ideas on Dither and Disp, or anything else that happens to catch my fancy. Copies of all my posts (except this one) will be on my repository under an open source license.

Take a look around, and if you like what you read, I’m sure there’s a button around here somewhere you can press. If you don’t, let me know in the comments and my brain will take it under consideration.That’s all for now, see you next week!
