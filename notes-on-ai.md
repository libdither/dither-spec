# Notes on AI

## The over/underfitting problem

Why can't we have an AI that can adjust the number of parameters it has? Have a separate neural network or some kind of external algorithm minimize the number of nodes in addition to minimizing the cost function. Why not feed the neural network structure as additional input to the network and allow the network to output modifications to the structure to minimize the cost function?
