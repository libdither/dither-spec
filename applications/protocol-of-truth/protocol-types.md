# Types of Labels for the Protocol of Truth

The protocol of truth is a protocol for applying labels to pieces of content. There are a lot of things a piece of content can be generally and specifically.

There are various labels for content. These labels are called `Type`s. They are typically split up into categories of Truths and Falses.

### Truths
What is Truth? What Makes something True? Truth is the quality of being

There are many kinds and reasons for falsities, but there is only two types of truth: Absolute Truths and Researched Truths. Absolute truths are typically self-evident, while Researched Truths need to be sourced. This is why the `Objections`.
 - `Researched Truth` 

`Absolute` - Absolute truths (e.g. the sun comes up every day)
 - `Common` - Truths that can be verified with a quick search (i.e. in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.)
 - `Researched` - Truths that result from a well-reviewed scientific study or observation (i.e. )

### Falses
 - `Error` - Category of falsities caused by error
   - `Simple` - Simple error
   - `Visual` - Error in visual
   - `Tecnical` - Error in technical details, bad math, bad labeling, bad graphs.
   - `Catastrophic` - Error in a part of the concept as a whole.
 - `Benign` - Category of falisies
   - `Comedy`
 - `Malignant` - Category of falsities caused intentional disinformation.
   - `Propaganda` - Content
   - `Sponsored`
     - `State`
     - `Corporate`
   - `Personal` - general category for conflict of interest, (e.g. promoting something that you benefit from being promoted)
 - `Misleading`
   - `Bad Context` - Label for content that takes things out of context
   - `Bad Graphs` - graphs which are technically correct but leave out core details.
