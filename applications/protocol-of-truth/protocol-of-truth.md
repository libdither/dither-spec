# Protocol of Truth

This is a protocol of back and forth debate with the aim to evaluate the quality and truthfulness of content posted to the internet.

If you have ever seen a photoshopped post on social media, or a video citing a badly done study, this techno-social protocol aims to inform through discourse the truthfulness of a given piece of media to anyone who might come across it.

The outcomes of this protocol label specific pieces of content. Here are some potential labels:

 - Truthful - Unobjectionably true
 - False - Unobjectionably false
   - Benign - False, for comedy, or other reasons
 - Factful - Well researched argument with generally accepted sources
 - Outdated - This might have been factful, but new information exists to provide alternative conclusions.
 - Opinionated - Content that is not sourced
 - Minority Opinion
 - Missing Context
 - 

These labels are determined dynamically and are subject to change and dispution. The history of labels and the conversation around them are stored. Certain labels can only be applied on top of specific other labels.

## Ideas

Idea: Instead of people upvoting and downvoting a given flag, they flag the flag and provide more supporting details. All this back and forth flagging results in a kind of "tree of flags" from which what is true, what is false, and what is ambiguous can be extracted.

Scene: Someone posts a video, there is an error in the video, someone posts a correction in the comment with a relevant tag.
