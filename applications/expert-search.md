# Expert Search

Goal: Efficiently connect people who are knowledgeable or want to learn about a subject with other people who are knowledgeable or want to talk about that subject.

Moonshot idea: Like google search, but instead or in addition to search results. You can find someone in that field to talk to. It finds the most available person who the system thinks will 1. be willing to chat, 2. know about what you are trying to learn about. The system will determine this through some kind of social karma / data mining thingy (like one of RadicalXChange proposal's).
