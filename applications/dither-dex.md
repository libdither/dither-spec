# Dither Decentralized Exchange

An exchange is a place that facilitates the exchange of goods (usually intangible ones). The Dither Exchange will be primarily geared towards the exchange of intangible goods, but it will support selling physical goods as well.

The core mechanism of the exchange is publically listing sell and buy orders and making them easily acessible to peers that satisfy certain constraints. (Perhaps they must prove that they are within a certain distance to the seller or that they have a certain amount of specific karma).
