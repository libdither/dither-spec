# Fractional Funding

This idea aims to solve the issue of effectively funding peer-to-peer creative endeavors.

# Rough Description

One really big idea which I think would improve the content economy (i.e. remove dependence on ads or sponsorships and make it more feasible for small creators to make a living) would be to have a system similar to YouTube premium where you pay a monthly subscription and the money gets distributed among the creators you watch, but instead of it being distributed among everyone you watch, its distributed only to people who make videos that you click a certain button on (lets say its like a heart-shaped button next to the "like" button), and you can click it multiple times to give multiple "shares" of your monthly subscription.
Then these shares are distributed to all these videos at the end of the month, but instead of simply going to the uploader of the video, there is a system that tries to identify either via user feedback or AI or something else parts of the video/content that were made by the original uploader, or that where taken from elsewhere to create a "fair" monetary distribution for that video. (i.e. to pay the artists and thumbnail drawers and anyone else)
and then depending on each user's preferences the money from each video can either go to everyone equally (weighted by distribution) or they can add further weights to prioritize people who have less income or things like that. 

# Formal Description

Users
 - People who consume content and set aside some fixed amount of money to give to creators.

Content
 - Pieces of data (videos, images, writing, etc.) by credit for its creation can be proportioned to some set of humans.

Creators
 - People who upload/remix content.

Goal: Take money from users and give it to creators in some fair manner.

Idea for Process to achieve Goal:
 - Each user watches a video and gives to it some fixed number of shares of monthly money they've set aside.
 - At the end of each month money for each video is collected from user's shares.
 - For each video's accrued amount 


The issue of funding stated formally:

There is some set of creators, each have some amount of income to which they need to achieve a basic standard of living and further income which they may want.

There is some set of users, each user has some amount of money they are willing to set aside to support the creators of content they consume.

For each user there is some distribution of fractional shares of the set-aside amount over the set of video created over the course.

Goal: Each creator should be paid from the pool of users who watch
