# The D Framework

The D framework is meant to be system for creating applications, documents, and any other kind of visual dynamic or static media. It is intended to replace the World Wide Web.


### What is the essence of a static piece of content?

A document, web page, or static site is kind of like a program with no inputs.

A pdf document typically contains all the things it needs to render a page to the user, but it doesn't contain the rendered data itself. It merely contains data used to render the page, such as text, fonts, images, formatting and so forth. For a static site, this data is in the form of HTML, CSS, and other linked data. Everything is fetched from the server and parsed into a viewable page. Unfortunately, HTML and CSS is not a particularly efficient format and not super generalized, meaning you are limited in the kinds of static experiences you can create.
