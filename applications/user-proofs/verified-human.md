# Verified Human Proof

The Verified Human Proof is a built-in anti-spam and anti-bot system that works across Dither. It is a zero-knowledge proof for prooving one-sidedly that an account is indeed used by a human.

There are two types of verified human proofs: marked human, trusted human, unique human.
 - A marked human signifies an account with human-like tendencies.
 - A trusted human is an account that has a unique human fingerprint that can be traced across accounts.
 - A unique human is an account marked that has been marked by a trusted 3rd party to be a verified human. 

It is easy to get the marked human proof. You can do achieve it simply by using Dither's social applications normally:
 - Use Dither often enough to be flagged as human enough times by other verified humans (of either type).

To get the trusted human mark, you can get it by using and posting on Dither for a long time, or uploading distinct features.
 - Become popular enough on Dither to create a profile that is flagged as human.

[WIP] To be prooved as a unique human, you must go to a 3rd party trusted by the community to verify humans.
