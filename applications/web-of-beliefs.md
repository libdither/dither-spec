# Web of Beliefs

The web of beliefs is a way for people to share with other people what they believe about the world and for people to form new beliefs based what their friends believe (e.g. beliefs about definitions) or whether or not new beliefs are suitably justified in a chosen framework of evaluating beliefs (e.g. Bayesian statistics).
