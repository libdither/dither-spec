# On Censorship

> Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information. [1]

Warning: Some Philosophy Ahead.

Dither is an internet protocol and internet protocols are products of the social constructs endorsed by the author(s). Social constructions are memes (i.e. darwinian agents), they live and die and change form by how many people believe/perpetuate them (sometimes weighted by how powerful those people are).

Another such social construction is the conception on what speech in what context is acceptable. So far, in liberal countries at least, speech is widely regarded as something to be protected. This protection however has some notable exceptions (in approximate order of legal severity):
 - Child sexual abuse material.
 - Non-consensual sexual imagery.
 - Restrictions on publishing false statements with intent to harm a reputation.
 - Restrictions on harassment (threatening/stalking) of individuals.
 - Restrictions on publishing copyrighted material.
 - Restrictions on speech that encourages violence towards a person or group.

Any good protocol engineer (and by extension social-construction-constructor) who wants their construction to be successful, should take into consideration potential conflict with the social construct under construction and other social constructions out in the world, constructions that may induce people to not spread yoru construction, or actively obstruct its propagation.

Without going full-deontological on the argument, this is why **Dither will very likely have some form of censorship**.

Much like TOR, USENET, IPFS, or BitTorrent, there seems to be a pattern where average people won't embrace a platform that makes it easy to distribute objectionable content on a widespread level.

The question is to what degree will the Dither protocol attempt to / will practically be able to restrict content? How will this censorship be implemented and how will circumventions be combatted?
